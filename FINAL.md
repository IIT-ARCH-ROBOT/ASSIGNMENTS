# Final
## Due Thursday July 14

### Overview
The final assignment for our Summer research is twofold, and consists of
* A functioning physical prototype or model
* A written research paper

### Details

#### Prototype
Whether you are making a robot or experimenting with fabrication, one major component of your final is the physical model or prototype. I have given you a lot of skills via our workshops and the work we have done together in our meetings. Every effort should be made to complete your model or prototype. I do understand that there are pitfalls when making things, so if something goes wrong at the last minute, don't worry too much. I know what is effort and what is not, and I will judge the completion of your final protype of model on this knowledge. You __MUST__ document your work with images or time based media like sound recordings or video. If the files are too large to include in your github repository, I will give you alternate instructions. This documentation should also be present in your research paper.

#### Paper
You will also turn in a written research document of no less than five pages including text and images. You paper should be organized in the following manner:
* Abstract/Summary: In one paragraph, explain your project and your expected outcome. I should understand the entire project from just reading the abstract.
* Concept: Explain your concept in detail.
* Materials and Methods: What materials did you use and how did you use them?
* Outcomes: What was the result?
* Conclusions: How does your result compare to your concept?
* Bibliography: List of sources, text, web, etc.

### Grading

Grades are pass/fail or satisfactory/unsatisfactory. I judge work on the following criteria:
* Completeness
* Craft
* Innovation/creativity
* Effort

### Delivery

All media should be present in your repository the night before July 14th. We will spend the entire day looking at everyone's project and discussing outcomes. If you need special equipment and/or space, let the instructor know several days in advance. Do not print your paper. It should be presented in PDF format only.
