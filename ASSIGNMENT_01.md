>Our first meeting was mainly an introduction to the studio coupled with a number of administrative tasks. Here's a TO-DO >list for next week:

* __DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL SOFTWARE TOOLS__ :floppy_disk:

>I introduced GitHub, a distributed content versioning system. We'll be using GitHub for all studio-related content including >administrative things like the [SYLLABUS](https://github.com/IIT-ARCH-ROBOT/SYLLABUS). You should have downloaded and >installed [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for your operating system as well as GitHub's open-source text >editor, [ATOM](https://atom.io/). 

* __GET COMFORATBLE WITH GITHUB AND SET UP A BLOG__ :mega:

As part of your participation in the studio, you must keep a research blog. I'd like you to do this using GitHub and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). There are many ways of setting up a blog, some complex, some simple. I think simple is best. To have a personal page or blog hosted by github, you must have a repository named YOUR_USERNAME.github.io in your master branch. I found this tool that helps set up a blog on GitHub: [TinyPress](https://tinypress.co/). If you already have a YOUR_USERNAME.github.io repository, delete it (you can do this by going to the settings tab of the repository. Go to https://tinypress.co/ and sign up and get going. It will create the repository for you and will allow you to do a bit of configuration. There's documentation that should help you do this. If you're stuck, email me @ brettbalogh@gmail.com
