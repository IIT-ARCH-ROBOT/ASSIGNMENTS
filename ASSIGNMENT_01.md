# ASSIGNMENT 01
## DUE TUESDAY MAY 31 2016

### TO-DO

Our first meeting was mainly an introduction to the studio coupled with a number of administrative tasks. Here's a TO-DO list for next week:

__DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL SOFTWARE TOOLS__ :floppy_disk:

I introduced GitHub, a distributed content versioning system. We'll be using GitHub for all studio-related content including administrative things like the [SYLLABUS](https://github.com/IIT-ARCH-ROBOT/SYLLABUS). You should have downloaded and installed [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for your operating system as well as GitHub's open-source text editor, [ATOM](https://atom.io/). 

__GET COMFORATBLE WITH GITHUB AND SET UP A BLOG__ :mega:

As part of your participation in the studio, you must keep a research blog. I'd like you to do this using GitHub and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). There are many ways of setting up a blog, some complex, some simple. I think simple is best. To have a personal page or blog hosted by github, you must have a repository named YOUR_USERNAME.github.io in your master branch. I found this tool that helps set up a blog on GitHub: [TinyPress](https://tinypress.co/). If you already have a YOUR_USERNAME.github.io repository, delete it (you can do this by going to the settings tab of the repository. Go to https://tinypress.co/ and sign up and get going. It will create the repository for you and will allow you to do a bit of configuration. There's documentation that should help you do this. If you're going to include images, and you should (it's a blog after all!), you'll have to upload them to a folder you create in the blog repository called media. You can then reference them using markdown in the blog post. If you're stuck, email me @ brettbalogh@gmail.com

__START BLOGGING__ :pencil2:

The first *research* assignment is to answer some questions using images and words and, well, whatever media you think works best. Respond to these prompts on your blog:

* What is architecture?
* What is a robot?
* How could a robot be architectural?
* How could architecture be robotic?

Blog posts should be formatted using markdown. You can find a guide here: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ 

__PURCHASE THE ADAFRUIT KIT__ :dollar:

__LIBRARY RESEARCH CLASS__ :books:
