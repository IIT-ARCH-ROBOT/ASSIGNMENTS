* __DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL SOFTWARE TOOLS__ :floppy_disk:

>I introduced GitHub, a distributed content versioning system. We'll be using GitHub for all studio-related content including >administrative things like the [SYLLABUS](https://github.com/IIT-ARCH-ROBOT/SYLLABUS). You should have downloaded and >installed [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for your operating system as well as GitHub's open-source text >editor, [ATOM](https://atom.io/). 

* __GET COMFORATBLE WITH GITHUB AND SET UP A BLOG__

As part of your participation in the studio, you must keep a research blog. I'd like you to do this using GitHub and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). There are many ways of setting up a blog, some complex, some simple. I think simple is best. To have a personal page or blog hosted by github, you must have a repository named YOUR_USERNAME.github.io in your master branch. 

* __START BLOGGING__
* __SHOP AUTHORIZATION__
* __LIBRARY RESEARCH CLASS__
