### DISCUSSION

Our first meeting was mainly an introduction to the studio coupled with a number of administrative tasks. Here's a TO-DO list for next week:

* __DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL SOFTWARE TOOLS__ :floppy_disk:

I introduced GitHub, a distributed content versioning system. We'll be using GitHub for all studio-related content including administrative things like the [SYLLABUS](https://github.com/IIT-ARCH-ROBOT/SYLLABUS). You should have downloaded and installed [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for your operating system as well as GitHub's open-source text editor, [ATOM](https://atom.io/). 

* __GET COMFORATBLE WITH GITHUB AND SET UP A BLOG__
