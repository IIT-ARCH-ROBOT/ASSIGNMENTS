# MIDTERM PRESENTATION

## DUE THE WEEK OF MONDAY, JUNE 20, 2016

The Midterm Presentation is comprised of three parts:
* A 500-word written abstract of the 5-page paper you will write for the Final including a bibliography of sources. This will be prepared in one letter-sized PDF that you will upload to the ASSIGNMENTS-DROPBOX/MIDTERM repository.
* A 36in x 24in presentation document (board) that visually describes your project. The content of the presentation should very clearly describe the design problem you are trying to solve and  illustrate the process and imagined outcome of the project. Do not print this board but rather save as a PDF.
* A bill of materials and a schedule to organize your efforts over the next four weeks. This should also be in letter-sized PDF format.
