# MIDTERM PRESENTATION

## DUE THE WEEK OF MONDAY, JUNE 20, 2016

The Midterm Presentation is comprised of three parts:
* A 500-word written abstract of the 5-page paper you will write for the Final including a bibliography of sources. This will be prepared in one letter-sized PDF.
* A 36in x 24in or closely-sized presentation document (board) that visually describes your project. The content of the presentation should very clearly describe the design problem you are trying to solve and  illustrate the process and imagined outcome of the project. Do not print this board but rather save as a PDF. Use your best visual communication skills to make this look awesome!
* A bill of materials and a schedule to organize your efforts over the next four weeks. This should also be in letter-sized PDF format.

All of these materials should be put in a folder labeled with your FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME that you create in the ASSIGNMENT-DROPBOX repository.
