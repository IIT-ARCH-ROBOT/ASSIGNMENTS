# ASSIGNMENT 02
## DUE THE WEEK OF MONDAY MAY 06

### TO-DO

Our second week was spend gettup to speed on rhino/grasshopper, laser cutter and the Particle Photon. Here's a TO-DO list for next week:

__RESEARCH (for Tuesday)__ :books:

Starting on Tuesday, May 7, we will be having research presentations on Tuesdays. Figure on getting up in front of class for 10 minutes to present research findings. You should have at least three sources by Tuesday. Ask Kim Soss in the library if you need help.

__FABRICATION (For Thursday)__:hammer:

We went through a tutorial on designing joints for a box in Rhino and used Grasshopper to make some parametric patterns to style the box. Please bring you completed box to class on Thursday. I have the fasteners.

__BLOGGING__ :pencil2:

Keep blogging. It will be useful for your research presentations. If you're still having issues, you can fork the Robot orginization's blog and use it as your own. I have it working pretty well at this point.

Blog posts should be formatted using markdown. You can find a guide here: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ 

__PHOTON__ :bulb:

Please kick the tires on your Photon now that we've set them up. Use the resources at [Adafruit](www.adafruit.com) and [Particle](www.particle.io) to write a program that will blink either the RGB led or the LED attached to pin7. We'll look at this on Thursday, too.


__I THINK THAT'S IT FOR NOW__ :clap:

I'll see you next week on TUESDAY @ 3pm in Crown 001. We will be meeting TR 3-6 from now on...Please email me with any questions.
